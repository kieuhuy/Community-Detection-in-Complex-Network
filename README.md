# Community-Detection-in-Complex-Network
This project involves utilizing a network dataset to accomplish two tasks. The initial dataset, known as the Witcher network, will be utilized to compare various community detection techniques: Girvan-Newman, Louvain, Leiden and Fuzzy node clustering algorithm. Then, a web application is built by using Streamlit in order to show the result in an interactive way.
